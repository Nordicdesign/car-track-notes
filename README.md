# car-track-notes

A crude tool to take notes of your racecar's behaviour while testing on Spa. It captures oversteer or understeer on turn entry, mid turn and turn exit.

Please note that **you can't save your progress**. If the browser's session is destroyed (e.g. closed the tab and opened a new one, changed device) it will start from scratch. But you can refresh your browser, that won't delete your notes. 

## How to use

1. Drive your new car on Spa
2. When you encounter understeer or oversteer, pause the sim
3. Tap on that turn, annotate what you have discovered
4. When you're ready go back to the pits and change the setup
5. Start again
